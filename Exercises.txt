Q: Write the result of the following expression below:
•	25 / 3 = 
•	20 - 12 / 4 * 2 = 
•	32 % 7  =
•	3 - 5 % 7 =
•	18.0 / 4  =
•	28 - 5 / 2.0 =
•	17 + 5 % 2 –3 =
•	15.0 + 3.0 * 2.0 / 5.0 =


Q: If x = 5, y = 6, z = 4 and w = 3.5, evaluate each of the following statements, if possible. If it is not possible, state the reason: 
•	(x + z) % y =
•	(x + y) % w =
•	(y + w) % x =
•	(x + y) *w =
•	(x % y) % z =
•	(x *z) % y = 
•	((x *y) *w) *z =

Q: Given: 
int num1, num2, newNum; 
double x, y; 
Which of the following assignments are valid? If an assignment is not valid, state the reason. When not given, assume that each variable is declared.
•	num1 = 35;
•	newNum = num1 – num2;
•	num1 = 5; num2 = 2 + num1; num1 = num2 / 3;
•	num1 * num2 = newNum;
•	x = 12 * num1 - 15.3;
•	num1 * 2 = newNum + num2;
•	x / y = x * y

Q: Suppose x, y, and z are int variables and w and t are double variables. What value is assigned to each of these variables after the last statement executes?
x = 17; 
y = 15; 
x = x + y / 4; 
z = x % 3 + 4; 
w = 17 / 3 + 6.5; 
t = x / 4.0 + 15 % 4 - 3.5

x =		y =		z =		w =		t = 		

Q: Suppose x, y, and z are int variables and x = 2, y = 5, and z = 6. What is the output of each of the following statements? 
•	System.out.println(“x=” +x+” ,y=”+y+” ,z=”+z);
•	System.out.println(“x + y =” +(x+y) );
•	System.out.println(“z / x =” +(z/x) );
•	System.out.println(“2 times”+ x + “ = “ + ( 2 * x ) );
